# What is Symphony?
Symphony is a Garry's Mod framework for creating (primarily serious text-based roleplay) gamemodes. It has been built primarily with flexibility in mind, with the ultimate goal that the look and feel of the gamemode should be fully customizable by non-developer power users.

## Goals
Build a framework that
- Performs at scale
- Allows non-developer power users to customize the look and feel to fit their server's theme.
- Simplifies via abstraction and/or solves common GMod limitations for developers.
- Provides new functionality and utilities to developers to enable them to build richer content.

## Structure
- Types
- Networking
- ORM
