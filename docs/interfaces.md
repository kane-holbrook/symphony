# Interfaces
Interfaces are an abstraction layer built around VGUI that facilitates:
- lifecycle management,
- lazy-loading of VGUI elements,
- the creation and registration of VGUI elements via XML, 
- calculated properties,
- procedural generation of gradients, materials and polygons,
- seamless CSS-style transitions
- improved drag & drop
